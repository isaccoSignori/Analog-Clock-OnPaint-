# Analog Clock in C# (2019)

This project is a small analog clock built using the `OnPaint` method in C#. It was originally part of a larger personal application I developed in 2019 when I had just started working as a developer.  

## Background  

At the time, I was learning C# in my free time and working on this personal project to help freelancers track their working hours, calculate earnings, and manage invoices. Unfortunately, despite completing the project, it was lost-along with my C# skills!  

The only surviving piece is this analog clock, which I decided to upload to GitHub since I couldn’t find a similar implementation online, and it took quite some effort to build.  

## Features  

- Draws an analog clock using the `OnPaint` method in C#.  
- Simple yet functional, showcasing basic graphics rendering in Windows Forms.  

## Notes  

I don’t think anyone has ever used this, but it’s always nice to look back and see where it all started!
